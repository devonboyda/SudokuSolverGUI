# SudokuSolverGUI

#This is a Sudoku Solver GUI. It displays an easy to use empty sudoku board. If you click on the boxes it will fill that box with a 1 and increment by 1 with each following click #until 9 which resets the box to empty. Fill the boxes with your sudoku puzzle and then click solve to have it solved for you. If there is no solution then it will display "No #Solution" and if you wish to reset your board at any time or after a solution simply click the reset button.
